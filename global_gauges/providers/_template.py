        This function should be implemented as an async function. The BaseProvider class
        will ensure that only 1 request to the provider API is made at a time (to prevent hammering
        the provider's server), and only uses the async feature to do some database manipulation with
        the dataframe we return here. There are two general ways I have implemented the async calls,
        although there are many more.

        1. Use the package aiohttp to make asynchronous http requests
            async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get(base_url, params=params) as response:
                response.raise_for_status()
                json_data = await response.json()
                df = pd.DataFrame(json_data)

        2. Wrap an asynchronous function in asyncio.to_thread()
            def some_synchronous_fn(site_id, start_date):
                ...
                return pd.DataFrame(data)
            df = await asyncio.to_thread(some_synchronous_fn, site_id, start_date)

        Option 2 is useful if you're using a library, like nwis for the USGS, that does not have a
        non-blocking data retrieval. Otherwise, Option 1 with aiohttp is very easy to imlement.
